# Fee_Casey-Portfolio
## Description

This website is my first website from scratch. It was created to showcase some of the skills and knowledge I've obtained through the University of Washington Full Stack Bootcamp so far. The largest section I had to problem solve was the project squares in the middle of the site and applying flex properties. A few tutorials later, we got what we have!

I also learned a lot including:

- How to apply smooth scrolling;
- Creating images that are hyperlinked;
- General CSS formatting using flex properties;
- Using and applyig variables throughout CSS;
- How to create a form (but not how to harvest inputs);
- Using Coloors to select a color pallet;
- and so much more!
